    <H2>Introduction</H2>
		This document is designed to take you through a few tutorials in order to familiarize
		you with the Basilisk data file format and scripting language.  The tutorials will
		begin simply, having you modify existing data files to add new data to them.  Later
		tutorials will show you how to write rules using the Basilisk scripting language.
		By the end of these tutorials, you should be comfortable writing a complete data
		file on your own.
		<P>
		All of these tutorials assume that you are working with the data set distributed with
		the Treasure Generator application by Jamis Buck.  Before each tutorial (unless the
		tutorial specifies otherwise) you should make a copy of the data directories, rather
		than working on the original data.  That way, if you make a mistake, you do not have
		to download the data set anew before you can use the program.
    <P>
    Please select a topic from the menu below:

		More tutorials to come, as I get time to write them.  If you have written a tutorial
		and would like it to be included in this document, please send it to
		<A HREF="mailto:minam@rpgplanet.com">Jamis Buck</A> (minam@rpgplanet.com).
