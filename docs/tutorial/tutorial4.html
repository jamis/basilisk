    <P>

    This tutorial assumes that:
    <OL>
      <LI>You have completed <A HREF="tutorial3.html">Tutorial #3</A>.
    </OL>

		So, now you want to add something to the Gem list huh?  Well this is also
		a very easy step -- moving from the art objects to the gems is pretty simple.

		<P>

		Open up the "gem.bsk" file in a text editor.

		<P>

		This file is somewhat small (only 3-4 pages) so it's not a lot to have to
		absorb.  Let's say that you want to add a gem called a "small rock."  Why?
		Who knows?  Maybe rocks are worth money in your game world. ;)

		<P>

		When you open the file you will see alot of gems set up like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
mossAgate { "moss agate" }
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

		The first part (one word, without any spaces) is the identifier that we will be
		adding (it won't actually be displayed by the treasure generator).  The 
		part in the brackets and quotes is the name that will actually be displayed.
		So we want to add a small rock.  At the bottom of the list of gems add 
		the line:

<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
smallrock { "small rock" }
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE> 

		Then you need to choose how much this gem is worth, because there are 
		average value categories just like in the art.bsk file.
		We decide that it is worth about 10 gold, so we need to place the name 
		<CODE>smallrock</CODE> in between the line reading <CODE>category
		group10gpGems</CODE> and the <CODE>end</CODE> keyword,
		which seperates these gems from the next, more valueable group.

		<P>

		Then, save the file and recompile the database just like you did in
		the tutorial for making a new art object.

		<P>

		Then generate a few treasures (encounter level 20, selecting "No Art"),
		and you should see your new gem!

    <P>
