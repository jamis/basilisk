    <P>

    This tutorial assumes that:
    <OL>
			<LI>You are using at least TG2 version 2.01.
      <LI>You have completed <A HREF="tutorial1.html">Tutorial #1</A>.
      <LI>You have deleted the previous contents of "dat/tutorial" and made a clean copy
          of "dat/standard" into "dat/tutorial".
    </OL>

    Well, you've modified the database.  But now, suppose you wanted to send your new weapon
    definition to a friend, so they could use it in their own database.  Hmmm -- you have to send
    them all your modified files, and if they have already modified those files, they will need
    to find some way to merge the changes into their existing data...  Ugly.  Ugly, ugly.

    <P>

    Fortunately, there is a clean solution.  What you need to do is define your new weapon in
    it's own file, and then all you have to do is send that one file to your friend!

    <P>

    For simplicity, I will just show here what the new file will look like, and then explain
    how we got it:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
weaponSpikedFist in ( groupWeapon groupPiercingWeapon groupMeleeWeapon 3:groupUncommonWeapons )
  .name "spiked fist"
  .cost 7 gp
  .damage 1d3
  .criticalRange 20
  .criticalMultiplier 2
  .weight 1 lb
  .size tiny
end
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    Hope you didn't blink, because that is <I>all</i> you need to put in your new file.  Notice that
    we didn't use the <b>template</b> syntax here, since we only had one item to define -- if we'd had
    to define several items (demonstrated below), we would have done better to use a template, but
    since we were only defining one item, this was a much shorter (and simpler) solution.

    <P>

    First, look at all the category names in the parentheses following our weapon's identifier.  This
    list is simply all the categories that the given thing belongs to.  And notice the "3:" before
    the "groupUncommonWeapons" -- this says that "weaponSpikedFist" has a weight of 3 in the category
    "groupUncommonWeapons".  If a weighting is not given, it is simply assumed to be 1.

    <P>

    Following the category list is the list of attributes.  This is the "long" syntax because each
    attribute is explicitly named by typing a "." followed by the name of the attribute, followed by
    the value of the attribute.

    <P>

    Now, before this will actually work in the treasure generator, we need to modify the <b>index.bsk</b> file
    so that it knows to read the file we just created.  First, save your new file as "myweapons.bsk", and open
    index.bsk.  Go to the very end of the file, and add a line that says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#include "myweapons.bsk"
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    This will cause the compiler to read your new file in addition to all the others mentioned in the
    index.bsk file.  That done, save "index.bsk", open the treasure generator, and compile it as you did
    in <A HREF="tutorial1.html">Tutorial #1</A>.

    <P>

    Now, since we're on the subject, what if you wanted to declare multiple new weapons?  Here's
    how:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
template in ( groupWeapon ) { name cost damage criticalRange criticalMultiplier weight size }
  weaponSpikedFist in ( groupPiercingDamage groupMeleeWeapon 3:groupUncommonWeapons )
                   { "spiked fist"  7 gp  1d3  20  2  1 lb  tiny  }
  weaponSerratedBlade in ( groupSlashingDamage groupMeleeWeapon 5:groupUncommonWeapons )
                   { "serrated blade"  18 gp  1d10  18  3  15 lb  large }
  weaponBarbedDart in ( groupPiercingDamage groupRangedWeapon 2:groupUncommonWeapons )
                   { "barbed dart"  5 sp  1d3  20  2  1/10 lb  tiny }
end

weaponBarbedDart
  .rangeIncrement 10 ft
end
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

    Notice how the template has a category list (containing one category, groupWeapon).  This
    means that all things defined in it are automatically in that category.  Each entry, too,
    may have a category list, so that each individual entry may be added to categories
    independent of the other entries being defined.

    <P>

    Lastly, notice that weaponBarbedDart is declared again after the template.  This is so that
    we can define any additional properties of the item (in this case, a range increment).  We
    could also have added "rangeIncrement" to the template's attribute list, but this would have
    been wasteful since most weapons don't have a range increment.  It was clearer to define
    the weapon again and add the necessary attributes.

    <P>

    Notice, now, that if you wanted to share your new weapons with a friend, all you have to do
    is send him the "myweapons.bsk" file.  He would then save it on his computer, modify the
    index.bsk file for his data so it looks at the new file, and then compile the database.

    <P>
