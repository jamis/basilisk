BSKCategoryMember* BSKGetCategoryMemberByWeight( BSKCategory* category, 
                                                 BSKUI32 weight );
</PRE>

  <B>Inputs:</B>
  <UL>
    <LI><i>category</i> - the category from which to get an item.
    <LI><i>weight</i> - the weight indicating the item to return.
  </UL>

  <B>Returns:</B> the category member occupying the given weight in
  the category, or 0 if no such member exists.

  <P>

  <B>Description:</B>
  Searches the given BSKCategory object for the BSKCategoryMember at
  the given "total" weight.  A member item's 'total weight' is the range
  of numbers starting at the sum of all previous item's weights to that
  value plus the member item's weight.
  <P>
  For example, if a category contained 4 items, weighted 2, 3, 1, and 4,
  the total weight would be 10.  The first item occupies the weights from
  1 to 2, the second from 3 to 5, the third occupies only weight 6, and
  the last item occupies the weights from 7 to 10.  If a weight of 5 were
  passed to this function, the second item would be returned (as it occupies
  the weights from 3 to 5).  Likewise, if a weight of 8 were passed in, the
  fourth item would be returned (occyping weights 7 to 10).
