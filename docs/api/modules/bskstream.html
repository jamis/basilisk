    <B>Defined in:</B>  bskstream.h<BR>
    <P>

    The BSKStream object encapsulates stream I/O, whether it be from a file
    or a buffer in memory.  If other streams are needed as well, it would
    not be difficult to make a new stream object (see bskstream.c for more
    info).
    <P>
    A BSKStream object has the following methods:
    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> close( <A HREF="../types/structs.html#BSKStream">BSKStream</A>* stream ) - closes (and disposes of) the 
          stream.  The given stream object is no longer valid after the
          stream is closed.  The method returns 0 on success.
      <LI><A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> read( <A HREF="../types/structs.html#BSKStream">BSKStream</A>* stream, <A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKNOTYPE">BSKNOTYPE</A> buffer, <A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKUI32">BSKUI32</A> len ) -
          reads up to 'len' bytes from 'stream' and puts them in 'buffer'.
          The method returns the number of bytes read, or -1 if there
          was an error, or the end of file was reached before any bytes
          could be read.
      <LI><A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> write( <A HREF="../types/structs.html#BSKStream">BSKStream</A>* stream, <A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKNOTYPE">BSKNOTYPE</A> buffer, <A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKUI32">BSKUI32</A> len ) -
          writes len bytes to stream from buffer.  The method returns the
          number of bytes actually written.
      <LI><A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> getch( <A HREF="../types/structs.html#BSKStream">BSKStream</A>* stream ) - returns the next character on
          the stream, or -1 if there was an error or EOF was reached.
      <LI><A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> putch( <A HREF="../types/structs.html#BSKStream">BSKStream</A>* stream, <A HREF="../types/types.html#BSKI32">BSKI32</A> c ) - puts the character c
          back into the stream, making it the character that will be
          read by the next call to getch.  Returns 0 if successful.
    </UL>

    Any new stream object must define all these methods.
