		<H1>Basilisk Data File Format</H1>

		Basilisk consists of <i>things</i>, <i>categories</i>, and
		<i>rules</i>.  This section will describe the format used
		to define <i>things</i> and <i>categories</i>.  To read
		about how to write <i>rules</i>, see the 
		<A HREF="script.html">scripting</A> section.
		<P>
		Basilisk requires that all attributes used in any definition
		of any thing be predeclared via the "attribute" statement.
		Any attributes not predeclared will generate errors during
		the parse of your data file.
		<P>
		Basilisk also supports units (like pounds, dollars, inches,
		meters, years, etc.), and allows you to convert between
		units easily and quickly.  You do not need to use units
		to use Basilisk, but they come in very handy.
		<P>

		<H2><A NAME="ident"></A>1. Identifiers</H2>

		The term "identifier" will be used extensively in this
		document.  It is essentially a term for a name given to an
		object.  For example, your name is an identifier that
		identifies you.
		<P>
		In the case of Basilisk, all identifiers must be unique.  You
		cannot have two separate things both named "Sword", for instance.
		You must make the identifiers unique by making them more
		descriptive:  "shortSword" versus "longSword", for example.
		<P>
		Note that those two identifiers both lacked a space to
		separate the words.  This is because identifiers cannot
		contain spaces.  They also cannot contain dashes, slashes,
		asterisks, ampersands, or any other punctuation.  In fact,
		the only valid characters you can put in an identifier are
		letters, numbers, and the underscore ('_'), and numbers
		can never be the first characters in an identifier.
		<P>
		Examples of valid identifiers:
		<UL>
			<LI>longSword
			<LI>Long_Sword
			<LI>bilbo1
			<LI>thing1234
			<LI>thing_1234
		</UL>
		Examples of invalid identifiers are:
		<UL>
			<LI>long sword <I>(has a space in it)</I>
			<LI>1longSword <I>(starts with a number)</I>
			<LI>long-sword <I>(has a dash in it)</I>
			<LI>bilbo&frodo <I>(has an ampersand in it)</I>
		</UL>
		Also, Basilisk is <i>case-insensitive</i>.  What this means, 
		is that whether you type your identifier as "longSword", or
		"LONGSWORD", or "lOnGsWoRd", it's all the same to Basilisk.
		Upper-case and lower-case make no difference, except in
		<i>strings</i> (see the section on <A HREF="#attr">Attributes</A>,
		below, for more on strings).

		<H2><A NAME="units"></A>2. Units</H2>

		To put it simply, units describe numbers.  If you ask someone
		(rather impertinently) how much they weigh, they are unlikely
		to just say "140".  If they did, you might wonder if that was
		in pounds, kilograms, etc.  The unit "pounds" is critical in
		this case to clarify the meaning of their answer.
		<P>
		Likewise, if you were playing a game of D&amp;D, and the
		DM says to you, "you just found 64!"  64 what?  It would
		make a big difference if he said "copper pieces" versus
		"platinum pieces."
		<P>
		Basilisk allows you to define units that you will use in your
		data file.  For example:
		<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
			unit cp;<BR>
			unit sp = 10 cp;<BR>
			unit gp = 10 sp;<BR>
			unit pp = 10 gp;<BR>
		</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
		What this tells you is that 1 sp ("silver piece") is worth
		10 cp ("copper pieces"), that 1 gp ("gold piece") is worth 10 
		sp, and that 1 pp ("platinum piece") is worth 10 gp.  This, as
		many of you will recognize, is the default monetary system of
		the D&amp;D universe.
		<P>
		The benefit of explicitly defining units in relation to other
		units (as in the example above), is that you can easily
		request the conversion of, say, 1552 cp into pp (1.552 pp).
		Basilisk will perform the work of converting it for you.
		<P>
		You could also do the following:
		<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
			unit second;<BR>
			unit round = 6 second;<BR>
			unit minute = 10 round;<BR>
			unit hour = 60 minute;<BR>
			unit day = 24 hour;<BR>
		</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
		The above is easily recognized as defining units of time.
		Note, however, that the units are not pluralized when they
		are referred to (i.e., it says "6 second", rather than
		"6 seconds").  This is because the plural form ("seconds" vs.
		"second") has not been defined as a valid unit.  This last
		example shows how to use plurals validly:
		<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
			unit second;<BR>
			unit seconds = 1 second;<BR>
			unit round = 6 seconds;<BR>
			unit rounds = 1 round;<BR>
			unit minute = 10 rounds;<BR>
			unit minutes = 1 minute;<BR>
			unit hour = 60 minutes;<BR>
			unit hours = 1 hour;<BR>
			unit day = 24 hours;<BR>
			unit days = 1 day;<BR>
		</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
		Note that you could also just declare the plural form (without
		the singular), but you would then wind up saying that a
		particular spell, for example, lasts for "1 rounds".  If you
		want your files to sound grammatically correct, your only
		real option is to either use abbreviations ("cp" vs. "copper
		piece") or to define both the singular and plural forms of
		each unit.

		<H2><A NAME="attr"></A>3. Attributes</H2>

		All attributes that will be used to define any thing in any
		of your files <i>must</i> be declared before you use them.
		This is accomplished by using the "attribute" statement.
		<P>
		An "attribute" statement lets you associate a given 
		identifier with a type.  The identifier must be unique in
		the file, and only be used to reference an attribute of
		a thing.
		<P>
		Here's some examples of attribute definitions:
		<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
			attribute name string<BR>
			attribute weight number<BR>
			attribute isSmart boolean<BR>
			attribute family thing<BR>
			attribute children category<BR>
			attribute nameRoutine rule<BR>
		</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
		Attributes may only be of the following types:
		<UL>
			<LI><b>string</b> - this is a sequence of characters between
					double quotes, "like this."  All characters between
					the quotes are taken literally, so strings are useful
					for things like names, descriptions, and narrative
					text.
			<LI><b>number</b> - the number type is very flexible in
					Basilisk.  It may be an integer, like 1, or 15, or
					-144, or it may be a floating point number, like
					3.141592, or 21.5.  However, numbers may also represent
					dice values, like 2d8, or 1d4+3, or 3d8*1000.  Numbers
					may also have <A HREF="#units">units</A> associated
					with them.
			<LI><b>boolean</b> - Boolean values are strictly limited
					to two values, "true" or "false."  You may also use
					"yes" or "no" and "off" or "on".  Boolean values are
					like light switches -- the light is either on or off.
					Thus, they are good for "yes" or "no" type answers,
					like whether or not one's sibling is smart.
			<LI><b>thing</b> - <A HREF="#thing">Things</A> are complex
					entities that are composed of various <A HREF="#attr">attributes</A>.
					You are a thing, as is the chair you are sitting on, or the
					emotion you are feeling for your boyfriend or girlfriend.
			<LI><b>category</b> - <A HREF="#category">Categories</A> are
					logical groupings or sets of things or other categories.
					The children of a family is a category, as is the set of
					all slashing weapons.
			<LI><b>rule</b> -- <A HREF="bskscript.html">Rules</A> describe
					processes, like "how do I select a name for my baby" or "how
					do I roll for ability scores."
		</UL>
		Give careful thought to your data model before you proceed,
		so that you can select the set of attributes that you will
		need for the things you create.

		<H2><A NAME="thing"></A>4. Things</H2>

		Things are the building blocks of the universe, and so you'll
		find that your data files will be <i>full</i> of them.  Because
		they are so ubiquitous, there are lots of ways to create them.
		You'll want to learn all the possible ways, because they each
		have their strengths and weaknesses.
		<P>
		The first way is the most straightforward:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
longSword
	.name "longsword"
	.cost 15 gp
	.weight 4 lb
	.size medium
	.damage 1d8
	.criticalRange 19
	.criticalMultiplier 2
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		This example assumes that "name", "cost", "weight", "size",
		"damage", "criticalRange", and "criticalMultiplier" have
		all been previously declared with the <A HREF="#attr">attribute</A>
		keyword, and that "gp" and "lb" have both been previously
		declared as <A HREF="#units">units</A>.
		<P>
		The example shows how you could define a longsword, with
		all of it's attributes.  You could then do the same thing
		for a flail, nunchaku, a quarterstaff, and so forth.
		<P>
		If you did so, however, you would quickly realize that you
		were typing the same attributes over and over -- name, cost,
		weight, size, damage, etc. being fairly common to most
		weapons.  If you find yourself entering attribute names
		over and over, you might want to look at the "template"
		statement.
		<P>
		<A NAME="thing1"></A>
		Templates allow you to abbreviate much of your data entry.
		Here's an example:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
template { name cost damage criticalRange 
           criticalMultiplier weight size }
	weaponClub { "club" $ 1d6 20 2 3 lb medium }
	weaponDagger { "dagger" 2 gp 1d4 19 2 2 lb tiny }
	weaponDart { "dart" 5 sp 1d4 20 2 1/2 lb small }
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		Notice how much easier that was!  You simply specify (in
		the curly braces after the "template" keyword) the list of
		attributes you want to define for each thing, and then
		you list each thing, followed by each of its attribute
		values in curly braces.  You will also notice the
		weaponClub thing -- instead of a price, it has a '$'
		character.  This means that a club has no price (not just
		"0 gp", but literally no price attribute), and that the
		parser should ignore that attribute for this thing.
		<P>
		The last method for entering things requires another example
		to demonstrate:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
flailSpecialAttack
	.name "bonus"
	.description "+2 to disarm attempts"
end

weaponFlail
	.name "flail"
	.cost 8 gp
	.damage 1d8
	.criticalRange 20
	.criticalMultiplier 2
	.weight 5 lb
	.size medium
	.bonus flailSpecialAttack
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		In this case, a flail has a bonus that grants a +2 to disarm
		attempts.  This bonus is a thing, because it has attributes
		that describe it.  However, because that bonus is only
		ever used once in the file, it seems a waste to even bother
		naming it, and it takes up 4 lines of the file!
		<P>
		<A NAME="thing2"></A>
		Anonymous things are things that are actually embedded
		within the definition of another thing or category.  They
		are not named (hence the term "anonymous"), and take up
		much less space in the data file.  They are also faster to
		parse.  Here's the same data as the example above, but with
		the "flailSpecialAttack" thing made anonymous:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
weaponFlail
	.name "flail"
	.cost 8 gp
	.damage 1d8
	.criticalRange 20
	.criticalMultiplier 2
	.weight 5 lb
	.size medium
	.bonus { .name "bonus" 
					 .description "+2 to disarm attempts" }
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		All we had to do was enclose the thing's attribute list in
		curly braces and put the result where we put the identifier
		before -- voila!  An anonymous thing!  You can use anonymous
		things anywhere that you would have referred to a thing's
		identifier before.  Note, however, that when you use an
		anonymous thing, you cannot refer to it again later, since
		it has no identifier.  Thus, you do not want to use an 
		anonymous thing when the thing will need to be referenced 
		multiple times in a data file.
		<P>
		One final note about things:  you may define and redefine
		the same thing over and over.  If a thing is encountered
		that has already been defined, the attributes in the
		second definition are <i>added to</i> the thing's previous
		attribute list.  It is <i>very important</i> to note that
		a thing may have multiple of the same attribute, so a
		redefinition will never overwrite an existing attribute!
		Be very careful with this, as the parser will not even
		issue a warning when you are redefining a thing.

		<H2><A NAME="category"></A>5. Categories</H2>

		Whereas things are the building blocks of the universe,
		categories are the glue that hold those blocks together.
		Things and categories really are inseparable in a 
		well-designed data file.
		<P>
		A category, in it's simplest form, has the following format:                
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
attribute name string
attribute birth string

template { name birth }
  Jamis { "Jamis Gordon Buck"  "25 Jul 1974" }
  Eric { "Eric Victor Bristow" "4 Feb 1976" }
  Nicole { "Nicole Suzanne Buck" "30 Apr 1976" }
  Emily { "Emily Rene Bristow" "28 Aug 1978" }
  Rebecca { "Rebecca Lynn Bristow" "3 Dec 1979" }
  Andrew { "Andrew Michael Bristow" "8 May 1986" }
end

category familyMembers
  Jamis
  Eric
  Nicole
  Emily
  Rebecca
  Andrew
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		This puts "Jamis," "Eric," "Nicole," "Emily," "Rebecca,"
		and "Andrew" grouped together in a category named
		"familyMembers."
		<P>
		A shorter way to do this, if you are using templates, is
		as follows:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
template <B>in ( familyMembers )</B> { name birth }
  Jamis { "Jamis Gordon Buck"  "25 Jul 1974" }
  Eric { "Eric Victor Bristow" "4 Feb 1976" }
  Nicole { "Nicole Suzanne Buck" "30 Apr 1976" }
  Emily { "Emily Rene Bristow" "28 Aug 1978" }
  Rebecca { "Rebecca Lynn Bristow" "3 Dec 1979" }
  Andrew { "Andrew Michael Bristow" "8 May 1986" }
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The "in" keyword, followed by the parenthesis after the
		"template" keyword lists all the categories that all things
		defined by this template will belong to.  The categories do
		not have to have been previously defined -- if they are not
		defined when the parser reads the template, a new category by
		that name is created.  Multiple categories may be specified
		here -- just separate each category name by at least one space.
		You can further define each individual member of the template to
		be in other categories, by putting a parenthetical list of 
		category identifiers after the thing identifier, like so:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
template ( familyMembers ) { name birth }
  Jamis <B>in ( buckFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
  Eric <B>in ( bristowFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
  Nicole <B>in ( buckFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
  Emily <B>in ( bristowFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
  Rebecca <B>in ( bristowFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
  Andrew <B>in ( bristowFamily )</B> { "..." "..." }
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		This, then, says that Jamis, Eric, Nicole, Emily, Rebecca,
		and Andrew are all "familyMembers", but that Jamis and Nicole
		are both in the "buckFamily" category, and Eric, Emily,
		Rebecca, and Andrew are all in the "bristowFamily" category.
		<P>
		Categories may also be specified when defining things with
		the basic format, as demonstrated here:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
longSword <B>in ( weapons slashingWeapons )</B>
.name "longsword"
.cost 15 gp
.weight 4 lb
.size medium
.damage 1d8
.criticalRange 19
.criticalMultiplier 2
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The parenthetical list after the thing's identifier states
		the list of categories that the thing belongs to.  If any
		of the categories have not yet been defined, they will be
		defined automatically.  In this example, the longSword
		thing is created and put automatically into the "weapons"
		category and the "slashingWeapons" category.
		<P>
		You may also weight the items in a category to determine
		their likelihood of being chosen randomly (see the 
		<A HREF="bskscript.html#fn_any">Any</A> function in the 
		<A HREF="bskscript.html">scripting</A> section).  Weights 
		are much like percentages, but you don't have to make sure 
		that the numbers total to 100.  For example, if you wanted 
		to randomly select a gem value, you might use the following
		category set up:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
category groupGemLookup
[50] { .cost 4d4 gp }
[30] { .cost 2d4*10 gp }
[25] { .cost 4d4*10 gp }
[15] { .cost 2d4*100 gp }
[ 9] { .cost 4d4*100 gp }
[ 1] { .cost 2d4*1000 gp }
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		First, note that the things in the category are declared
		<A HREF="#thing2">anonymously</A>.  Second, notice the
		numbers in square brackets -- those are the weight value
		for each thing.  The total of the weights, in this case,
		is 50+30+25+15+9+1=130, and the chance of any of the items
		being chosen at random is the thing's weight divided by
		the total weight. So, a 4d4 gp gem will be chosen 50 times
		out of 130 (about 38.5%), while a 2d4*1000 gp gem will only
		be chosen roughly once in 130 times (about 0.75%).
		<P>
		Note that if weights are not specified, they default to 1.
		If a weight is specified, however, it must be an integer
		value (it cannot have a fractional value, or numbers after
		the decimal point).
		<P>
		<A NAME="category1"></A>
		Lastly, just as things may be declared <A HREF="#thing1">anonymously</A>,
		so may categories.  An anonymous category declaration may
		be used anywhere a category identifier would be used, and
		is simply the category members (including weights, if you
		want them) enclosed in parentheses.  For example:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
attribute name string
attribute favoriteMovies category

template <B>in ( allMovies )</B> { name }
Bambi { "Bambi" }
RobinHood { "Robin Hood" }
TrumanShow { "The Truman Show" }
MrHollandsOpus { "Mr. Holland's Opus" }
Contact { "Contact" }
BugsLife { "A Bug's Life" }
ToyStory2 { "Toy Story 2" }
end

Jamis
  .name "Jamis Buck"
  .favoriteMovies ( ToyStory2 
                    BugsLife 
                    TrumanShow 
                    { .name "Secret of Roan Inish" } )
end

Tarasine
  .name "Tarasine Buck"
  .favoriteMovies ( [3] MrHollandsOpus 
                    Contact 
                    TrumanShow )
end
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		In this example, a list of movies is declared and then, for
		each person (in this case, me and my wife), a category is
		declared anonymously, containing our favorite movies.  (The
		contents of the categories are listed one per line for
		space limitation reasons -- there is no reason they could
		not be strung out on one line, if you preferred).
		<P>
		I got tricky in my movie list.  Perhaps you noticed
		the anonymous thing, listed in the anonymous category!  You
		can nest them as deep as you need to.
		<P>
		Lastly, notice in my wife's movie list that the movie
		"Mr. Holland's Opus" is weighted so that it will be chosen
		3 times out of 5.  The other two movies are left to the
		default weighting of 1, each being chosen 1 time out of 5.
		You can use weightings wherever you feel you will need them.
		<P>
		A special thing, "null," may also be used in a category to
		indicate that the particular category member is non-existant.
		Any given category may only contain <i>one</i> null member.
		<P>
		One final note about categories:  you may define and redefine
		the same category over and over.  If a category is encountered
		that has already been defined, the members of the
		second definition are <i>added to</i> the category's previous
		member list.  It is important to note that a category may 
		only have one of any given thing or category, and multiples
		are silently ignored.  Be very careful with this, as the 
		parser will not even issue a warning when you are redefining
		a category.

		<H2><A NAME="include"></A>6. Including Files</H2>

		You may have noticed by now that any realistic set of data
		will be quite large.  It is often not going to be reasonable
		to assume that it could all be managed in one file.  Also,
		there are times when you would like one part of your data
		to be shared in multiple different databases (one for D&D,
		one for Star Wars, etc.).  How to handle that?
		<P>
		The answer, my friend, lies in Basilisk's ability to include
		the contents of one file from within another.  Here's an
		example:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
#include "coredata.bsk"
</PRE>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		C-programmers everywhere should immediately recognize this
		as shamelessly stolen from that language.  All it does,
		in essence, is temporarily stop parsing the current file,
		and jump into the file referenced in the quotes.  That file
		is completely parsed into the database, and then the parser
		jumps back into the original file where it left off and
		continues.
		<P>
		Any given file may include any number of files, each of
		which may include files, etc.  The Baslisk parser includes
		a safeguard which will prevent a file from being included
		more than once, so you don't have to worry about redefining
		your categories or things, either.

		<H2><A NAME="conclusion"></A>7. Conclusion</H2>

		Well, that's about the gyst of it.  All that remains is
		for you to master the scripting aspects of Basilisk, and
		you'll be armed and dangerous!
		<P>
		If you feel you're ready, <A HREF="script.html">proceed
		to the scripting section</A>!
