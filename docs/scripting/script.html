	Whereas <A HREF="dff.html#thing">things</A> form the 
	building blocks of a Basilisk-defined universe, and
	<A HREF="dff.html#category">categories</A> form the glue
	that holds those blocks together, <i>rules</i> define how
	the things and categories interact and behave.  They are
	also used to define "functional" values -- those values
	(like ability score bonuses in D&amp;D) that are computed,
	rather than looked up.
	<P>
	This document will discuss the syntax of rules in Basilisk,
	and will demonstrate through various examples how they are
	written and used.

	<H2><A NAME="rules"></A>1. Rules, rules, rules!</H2>

	Here's an example of a very simple (and quite useless) rule:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
<b>rule</b> myVeryFirstRule<b>()</b>
/* this is a multi-line
comment! It can stretch for as long as
you want. */

x = 2 + 2;

// this is a single-line comment!
<b>end</b>
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example demonstrates some very basic, but very
	important, points:
	<OL>
		<LI><I>All rules are declared with the 'rule' keyword.</I>
				There is only one way to declare rules (unlike things
				and categories, which may even be declared anonymously)!
		<LI><I>The rule's identifier must immediately follow the
				rule keyword.</I>  This identifier must be unique.
		<LI>Note the empty parenthesis after the identifier.
				<I>You must always put these parenthesis here</I>.  In
				a later example I'll show you exactly what these are
				for.
		<LI><I>Comments may be specified either between /* and */ or
				on one line following //.</I>  Comments are text that
				you may insert liberally into your rules to help people
				that later look at them to understand what is happening.
				Use comments often, and use them well!
		<LI><I>All rules are terminated by the 'end' keyword,</I>
				just like things, templates, and categories.
		<LI><I>All statements (except those ending with the 'end' keyword)
				must end with a semicolon ';'.</I>  You'll run into all
				kinds of problems if you forget even one semicolon,
				anywhere!  In the same vein, if you put a semicolon
				where you're not supposed to (like after the 'end'
				keyword), you'll get problems, too.
	</OL>
	That little letter 'x' is what is called a "variable."  Those
	of you who didn't sleep through basic algebra in high
	school will be familiar with that term.  For the rest of you,
	a variable is simply place that you can put values.  In
	Basilisk, a variable may hold any type of value, be it
	numeric, string, boolean, thing, category, rule, or
	otherwise.  And in the example shown above, the variable
	x "gets" (that's how you read that '=' sign) the result of
	2 + 2, or 4.
	<P>
	Notice that this also demonstrates how to compute values.
	You can use '+' and '-' for addition and subtraction (respectively),
	'*' for multiplication, '/' for division, '^' for exponentiation,
	and '%' for modulus division (where you get the remainder
	instead of the result).  Also, anywhere you would normally
	put a number in a formula, you can also put a variable (as
	long as the variable contains a value appropriate to the
	operation being performed).  For example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule myNextRule()
x = 15;
y = x * 3;
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example assigns the number 15 to x, and then assigns
	x times 3 to y.  Since x is 15, y will get the value 45
	(15 times 3).  Make sense?  Great!  We'll talk more about
	math in the section on <A HREF="#ops">operators</A>.
	<P>
	One other thing.  Although a rule will always terminate when
	it reaches the 'end' keyword at the end of a rule, there
	are times when you want to exit a rule early.  You can do
	this with the "exit rule" statement:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule exitDemo()
/* stuff here */

<b>exit rule</b>;

/* more stuff here */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The rule will end when it reaches the "exit rule"
	statement.

	<H2><A NAME="parm"></A>2. Parameters and Return Values</H2>

	Well.  That's all fine and dandy, right?  You know how to
	add 2 and 2.  Now, suppose you had something like this:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule hereIsAnUglyOne()
y = 15;
x = ( ( 3 * y ) / 2 ) + 1;
/* do something with x here */
x = ( ( 3 * y ) / 2 ) + 2;
/* do something else with x here */
x = ( ( 2 * y ) / 2 ) + 1;
/* do something else with x here */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What if you could simplify this a bit?  What if there were
	a way to just send the values that change in each formula
	to another rule and have that rule return the result?
	<P>
	You've probably guessed that there is, indeed a way to do it.
	Observe this next example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule doMyFormula( <b>a b c</b> )
doMyFormula = ( ( a * b ) / 2 ) + c;
end

rule hereIsAnUglyOne()
y = 15;
x = doMyFormula( 3, y, 1 );
/* do something with x here */
x = doMyFormula( 3, y, 2 );
/* do something else with x here */
x = doMyFormula( 2, y, 2 );
/* do something else with x here */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Hope you didn't blink, or you would have missed it!  What we
	did here is define a new rule, called 'doMyFormula' that
	takes 3 <i>parameters</i>.  A parameter is a value that you
	can send to a rule, and rule's can accept any number of
	parameters.
	<P>
	The three variables ('a', 'b', and 'c') in the parenthesis
	beside 'doMyFormula' are the parameter list of
	'doMyFormula'.  In 'hereIsAnUglyOne', the three values
	in the parameter list beside doMyFormula get mapped,
	value-by-value, to those three variables ('a', 'b', and 'c').
	<P>
	By assigning the result of the formula to 'doMyFormula',
	we are essentially saying that 'doMyFormula' will return
	the calculated value as it's <i>return value</i>.  You'll see
	that we actually assign that return value to x three times
	in 'hereIsAnUglyOne'.
	<P>
	Even though a given rule may only have 3 arguments, you
	can pass as many parameters to it as you want, or as few.
	If you pass fewer parameters than the rule expects, the
	remaining arguments are automatically initialized to null.
	You may use the <A HREF="#fn_parameter">Parameter</A> 
	function to access parameters beyond those declared by the
	rule.
	<P>
	You'll see a lot of parameters and return values before this
	documentation is done.

	<H2><A NAME="ops"></A>3. Operators</H2>

	Operators are things like '+' and '-'.  In Basilisk, you
	can use operators to perform mathematical calculations, and
	to perform string concatenation.
	<P>
	Here's an example of all the mathematical operators:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule operatorDemo()
x = 3 + 2; /* gets 5 */
x = 3 - 2; /* gets 1 */
x = 3 * 2; /* gets 6 */
x = 3 / 2; /* gets 1.5 */
x = 3 ^ 2; /* gets 3 squared, or 9 */
x = 3 % 2; /* gets 1, or 3 mod 2 */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	The '+' operator may also be used to catenate two strings
	together, like so:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule operatorDemo2()
x = "Hello " + "World"; 
/* gets "Hello World" */
x = "I am " + 26 + " years old"; 
/* gets "I am 26 years old" */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice that when you "add" strings and numbers together,
	the numbers are converted to strings and catenated into
	the final result.
	<P>
	Other operators are used to test equivalence.  These are:
	<UL>
		<LI><b>eq</b> -- test to see if two values are equivalent.
		<LI><b>ne</b> -- test to see if two values are not equivalent.
		<LI><b>gt</b> -- test to see if one value is greater than
				another.
		<LI><b>lt</b> -- test to see if one value is less than
				another.
		<LI><b>ge</b> -- test to see if one value is greater than
				or equal to another.
		<LI><b>le</b> -- test to see if one value is less than or
				equal to another.
	</UL>
	Each of the above operators returns a <i>boolean</i> (true
	or false) value as the result.  Here's an example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule comparisonDemo()
x = 3 eq 4; /* gets false */
x = "nice" ne "mean" /* gets true */
x = 7 le 9; /* gets true */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P>
	There are two other operators you can use.  These are
	<b>and</b> and <b>or</b>.  The <b>and</b> operator will
	return true only if both of the operands are true.  The
	<b>or</b> operator will return true if either of the operands
	are true.
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule conjunctionDemo()
x = 3 eq 4;
y = 7 le 9;
z = x or y; /* gets true */

x = 3 lt 2;
y = "b" eq "c";
z = x and y; /* gets false */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is also this little issue called "operator precedence."
	What it means is that, for example, before you perform
	addition, you perform all multiplications first.  In other
	words, 'multiplication' has a higher precedence than 
	'addition'.
	<P>
	Precedence in Basilisk behaves just as it does in math, with
	expressions being evaluated left-to-right in order of
	precendence.  To wit:
	<UL>
		<LI>Lowest precedence: eq ne gt lt ge le
		<LI>+ -
		<LI>* / %
		<LI>Highest precedence: ^
	</UL>
	Also, expressions in parentheses are performed as if they
	had an even higher precedence.  For example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule operatorPrecedenceDemo()
x = 3 ^ 2 + 1; /* x gets 10 */
x = 3 ^ ( 2 + 1 ); /* x gets 27 */
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In the first example, "3 ^ 2" is evaluated first, and then
	1 is added to the result.  In the second, "2 + 1" is
	evaluated, and 3 is then raised to the resulting power.

	<H2></A>4. Conditional Branching</H2>

	Sometimes you only want a particular statement to execute
	if a certain condition is true.  For instance, you only
	want your age to increase <i>IF</i> it is your birthday
	(and even then, some people would stop it if they could).
	Basilisk supports then kind of "branching" via an 'if'
	statement.
	<P>
	For example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule ifDemo( something )
<b>if</b> something eq 5 <b>then</b>
/* do some processing */
<b>end</b>
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The above example will test to see if the parameter
	'something' equals 5, and if it does, it will perform
	some sequence of actions.
	<P>
	Sometimes you want one thing done if a condition is true,
	and another if it is false.  You can use the 'else'
	clause to accomplish this:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule ifDemo2( something )
if something eq 5 then
/* do some processing */
<b>else</b>
/* do something else */
end
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And <i>sometimes</i>, you want 'a' if 'b', or 'c' if 'd',
	or 'e' if 'f', or otherwise just do 'g', like so:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule ifDemo3( something )
if something eq 5 then
/* do some processing */
<b>elseif</b> something lt 2 <b>then</b>
/* do something else */
<b>elseif</b> something lt 10 <b>then</b>
/* do something else */
else
/* do the default action */
end
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The 'else' clause is always optional, and need not be
	specified if it is not needed.
	<P>
	There is one other way to do conditional branching in
	Basilisk.  This is via the 'case' statement.  Sometimes you
	just want to perform some action if something has a
	particular value.  The 'case' statement is ideal for this:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule caseDemo( something )
<b>case</b> something
<b>is</b> 1 <b>then</b>
/* do something */
<b>is</b> 2 <b>then</b>
/* do something */
<b>is</b> 3 <b>then</b>
/* do something */
<b>is</b> 4 <b>then</b>
/* do something */
<b>is</b> 5 <b>then</b>
/* do something */
<b>default</b>
/* do something if it is none
of the specified values */
<b>end</b>
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice that the case statement ends with the 'end'
	keyword.  Also, the 'default' section is optional --
	you don't need to specify it if you don't need it.  You
	can also test non-equivalency with case statement, as
	follows:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule caseDemo( something )
case something
is 1 then
/* do something */
is <B>not</B> 2 then
/* do something */
end
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This has limited uses, however, and actually is almost
	equivalent to the 'default' statement in most cases.

	<H2><A NAME="loop"></A>5. Looping</H2>

	Sooner or later, you'll find that you want to perform
	some action over and over again.  You'll want to generate
	ten random magic items, or create ten random characters.
	Sure, you could just write the code to generate one item
	or character, and then copy it 10 times, but what happens
	what you suddenly decide you need 20, or 100?  That's right,
	you turn to loops.
	<P>
	There are three types of loops in Basilisk, 'for' loops,
	'while' loops, and 'do' loops.  Let's look at them in
	that order.
	<P>
	<A NAME="for"></A>
	<I>For Loops</I>
	<P>
	A for loop looks like this:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule forLoopDemo()
x = 0;
y = 0;
<b>for</b> i <b>=</b> 1 <b>to</b> 10 <b>do</b>
x = x + 1;
y = y + i;
<b>end</b>
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example first sets the variable x to be 0.  Then, for
	all values of i from 1 to 10, the statement "x = x + 1" is
	executed.  By the end of the 10th iteration, the variable
	x contains the number 10 (it was incremented by 1,
	10 times).
	<P>
	The value of y is a little trickier.  The first time through
	the loop, the value of i is 1, and that value is added to y
	(initially 0), making 1.  The second time through the loop,
	i is 2, which is added to y (now 1), making 3.  The third
	time through the loop, i is 3, and this is added to y,
	making 6.  This continues through 10 iterations, and at the
	end, y is 55, the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 10.
	<P>
	There's nothing that says a for loop needs to start at 1.
	You can start it at 5, or 15, or -3.  However, since the
	loop goes upward, if you specify a "to" number that is
	less than the "from" number, the loop will not execute
	even once.
	<P>
	There is one other format for a "for" loop:  you can use it
	to iterate through all the values in a
	<A HREF="dff.html#category">category</A>.  Here's an
	example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
attribute cost number

category testCategory
{ .cost 5 }
{ .cost 1 }
{ .cost 11 }
{ .cost 4 }
end

rule forLoopDemo2()
total = 0;
<b>for</b> i <b>in</b> testCategory <b>do</b>
total = total + i.cost;
<b>end</b>
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this example, the variable 'i' will, for each time through
	the loop, be a different one of the members of the 'testCategory'
	category.  The first time through the loop, i is the first
	thing in the category, the second time, it is the second
	thing, and so on.  One caveat, however:  if the category
	contains a "null" member, the loop will stop processing
	when it reaches it.
	<P>
	Notice also how attributes of things are referenced -- with a
	'.' followed by the attribute name.
	<P>
	<A NAME="while"></A>
	<I>While Loops</I>
	<P>
	A "while" loop is a bit different than a "for" loop.
	Essentially, it performs an action "while" a given condition
	is true.  Here's an example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule whileLoopDemo()
x = 0;
<b>while</b> x lt 10 <b>do</b>
x = x + 1;
<b>end</b>
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example increments x by 1 "while" x is less than 10.
	Since x starts as 0, the loop will execute 10 times.
	<P>
	The condition is evaluated each time the loop is executed,
	before anything in the loop is executed.  This means that
	if the condition is not true when the loop is first
	encountered, the loop will not execute.
	<P>
	<A NAME="do"></A>
	<I>Do Loops</I>
	<P>
	A "do" loop is much like a "while" loop, except that the
	condition is tested at the <i>end</i> of the loop, instead
	of the <i>beginning</i>.  This means that the loop will
	always execute at least once.  Here's an example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule doLoopDemo()
x = 0;
<b>do</b>
x = x + 1;
<b>loop while</b> x lt 10;
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example does exactly what the "while" loop example
	does -- it counts to ten.
	<P>
	<A NAME="exit"></A>
	<I>Exiting Loops Early</I>
	<P>
	A final note about loops -- loops will exit when the
	specified condition is met, but there may be times when you
	want to terminate the loop early.  You can do it with the
	"exit loop" statement, much like the "exit rule" statement
	described earlier.  Here's an example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
rule exitLoopDemo()
x = 0;
while true do
x = x + 1;
if x ge 10 then
<b>exit loop</b>;
end
end
end
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this (rather contrived) example, notice that the loop
	condition is always true, meaning that the while loop will
	never exit!  However, the 'if' test within the loop will
	ensure that when/if the variable x is greater than or equal
	to 10, the "exit loop" statement will be executed, which
	will terminate the loop.
	<P>
	The "exit loop" statement may be used to exit out of any
	of the loop types (for, while, and do).

	<H2><A NAME="array"></A>6. Arrays</H2>

	Sometimes you may have a list of values that you want to
	treat as a single entity, like the names of all your friends.
	Such a grouping is especially useful if you want to sort
	those names and get them in alphabetical order.  You can
	use arrays for this.
	<P>
	Arrays are created by calling the <A HREF="#builtin">built-in</A>
	function, <A HREF="#fn_newarray">NewArray</A>.  Here's an
	example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
a = NewArray();
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This example creates a new array with no elements.  Elements
	of an array are referenced by using square brackets '[' and
	']', with the index of the element you want within the
	square brackets, like this:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
a[5] = "Hello";
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This assigns the word "Hello" to the element at index 5
	of the array.  Note that the first element in an array is
	at index 0, not 1.  Also, if the array is not large enough
	to have an element at the index given, the array is
	automatically grown to fit it.  For example:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
a = NewArray();
a[3] = "Hello";
a[15] = "World";
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Here, an empty array is created, with no elements.  The
	second statement assigns "Hello" to index 3, which causes
	the array to grow to include index 3.  The third statement
	assigns "World" to index 15, and again the array is grown.
	All elements not explicitly assigned to (like element 1, or
	4, etc. in the example above) are given the value "null".
	<P>
	If you know how big you want your array to be, you can make
	your rules a little faster by specifying the initial size
	of the array, as follows:
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
a = NewArray( 15 );
a[3] = "Hello";
a[15] = "World";
</PRE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In this example, the array is initialized with 15 elements
	(indices 0 to 14).  When index 3 is assigned to, the array
	doesn't have to grow because index 3 is already included.
	However, index 15 (the 16th element, because the first is
	index 0), is not included, so the array has to grow by 1
	element to include index 15.
	<P>
	Lastly, you can sort arrays using the <A HREF="#builtin">built-in</A>
	function <A HREF="#fn_sort">Sort</A>.

	<H2><A NAME="builtin"></A>7. Built-In Functions</H2>

	Basilisk comes all set with quite a few built-in "functions."
	If the term "function" is unfamiliar to you, think of it as
	a rule.
	<P>
	What follows is a list of all the built-in functions in
	Basilisk, and what parameters they take, and what values
	they return (if any).
	<UL>
		<LI><A NAME="fn_add"></A>
				<b>Add( category, item )</b><BR>
				<b>Add( category, item, weight )</b><BR>
				The "Add" function adds the given item to the given
				category.  The 'item' must be either a thing, a
				category, a rule, or the "null" keyword.  The 'weight'
				parameter is optional, and if specified, it is used
				as the weight for the item in the category (see the
				description of weighting in the section on
				<A HREF="dff.html#category">categories</A>).  If
				the weight is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.
		<LI><A NAME="fn_any"></A>
				<b>Any( category )</b><BR>
				This function returns an item at random from the given
				category, taking into account the weighting of the
				items.  The item is not removed from the category. See
				also <A HREF="#fn_getbyweight">GetByWeight</A> and
				<A HREF="#fn_totalweightof">TotalWeightOf</A>.
		<LI><A NAME="fn_attributenameof"></A>
				<b>AttributeNameOf( thing, index )</b><BR>
				This function returns the name of the attribute at
				the given index.  The first attribute is at index 0,
				the second is at index 1, etc.  If there is no attribute
				at the given index, this function returns the empty
				string "".
		<LI><A NAME="fn_attributeof"></A>
				<b>AttributeOf( thing, name )</b><BR>
				This function returns the attribute with the given
				name in the given thing.  If the attribute does not
				yet exist, it is created.  This value may be assigned
				to.
		<LI><A NAME="fn_attributevalueof"></A>
				<b>AttributeValueOf( thing, index )</b><BR>
				This function returns the value of the attribute at
				the given index.  The first attribute is at index 0,
				the second is at index 1, etc.  If there is no attribute
				at the given index, this function returns null.
		<LI><A NAME="fn_convertunits"></A>
				<b>ConvertUnits( number, units )</b><BR>
				Converts the given number from whatever units it is
				currently in to the units specified by the string
				"units".  If the units are incompatible, you'll get
				an error, otherwise, the converted number is
				returned.
		<LI><A NAME="fn_count"></A>

		<LI><A NAME="fn_sort"></A>
				<b>Sort( array, comparer )</b><BR>
				Sorts the given array, and returns it (though the
				parameter is changed as well).  The comparer must be
				a rule that you have defined that accepts two 
				parameters, and returns -1 if the first is less than
