  Makefile changes:
    Added an 'update' target for CVS.
  Data Changes:
    Added data for Netbook of Magical Treasures.
    Fixed error in scrolls.bsk where StinkingCloud was being given as a
      second level spell, instead of a third.

version 1.02
	Documentation Changes:
		Added tutorial3, tutorial4, and tutorial5, submitted by Richard Avery.
	Data Changes:
		Added optAlwaysCursed attribute to attributes.bsk.
		Added check for optAlwaysCursed in rItemDeservesCurse in utilities.bsk.
  Makefile changes:
    Use $(RM) instead of 'rm -f'.
    Remove both plain and ".exe" binaries (Win32-Unix mixed environments).
  Utility changes:
    Added config.h.  Eventually, need to move to autoconf environment.
    Updated bskrun.c, bskcompile.c, bsktreasure.c to use config.h instead
      of duplicating common header information.
    Compile cleanly under cygwin environment.  However, this might break
      environments which were trying to implicitly include <unistd.h>.
	Library changes:
		There were implicit typecasts in bskexec.c, bskvalue.c, and bskparse.c
		  that were causing C++ compilers to have problems.  These have been
			changed to explicit typecasts.
		bsklexer.c, in s_nextChar, was not forcing the read character to be a
		  '\r' if a '\n' was found following a '\r'.
		The FILE_SEPARATOR define for MACOS was added.
		Substreams in s_parseMeta were being opened in text mode, which is not
			portable.

version 1.01
  Makefile changes:
    Added a RUNLIBS variable.  Swapped order of -lbasilisk and -lm so that
      math library would be picked up correctly on some platforms.
    Re-did Makefile to allow selection of various targets (type "make"
      without arguments to get a list of supported targets).  Supported
      targets now include a dynamically linked Basilisk library.
  Utility changes:
    Changed names of 4 callback functions in bskcallback.c:
      myConsole -> BSKDefaultConsole
      myRTEHandler -> BSKDefaultRuntimeErrorHandler
      myErrorHandler -> BSKDefaultParseErrorHandler
      printStackTrace -> BSKPrintStackTrace
    Added a FILE* parameter to BSKPrintStackTrace.
    Added a new type to bskcallback.h (BSKCallbackData) which should be
      passed as the "userData" parameter to BSKExec and BSKParse
      whenever one of the "default" callbacks are used.
    Changes bskcompile.c, bskrun.c, and bsktreasure.c to use the new
      callback functions.
    Modified BSKPrintStackTrace to use new "line" member of BSKStackFrame
      to tell what line of what rule was called, for each level of the
      stack.
    Modified bsktreasure.c to correctly set default options if none are
      specified.
  Documentation Changes:
    Modified script.bnf to reflect the new preferred syntax for specifying
      parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
    Modified dff.html to include documentation for new preferred syntax
      for specifying parent categories for entities (using the "in"
      keyword).
    Modified tutorial1.html to use new preferred syntax for specifying
      parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
    Added a new tutorial (tutorial2.html) -- "Adding Data, Part 2"
    Added undocumented functions from bskexec.
  Data Changes:
    Modified all data files to use the new preferred syntax for specifying
      parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
    Alphabetized deity list in deities.bsk.
    Replaced gems.bsk with data from Spencer Cooley (MUCH more detail).
    Modified rings.bsk, wands.bsk, and staves.bsk to compute item cost
      proportionally to the number of charges remaining in the item.
    Modified "rGetAnyMatchingCriteria" rule (in utilities.bsk) to accept
      an optional third parameter ("recursive") that, when true, indicates
      that rGetAnyMatchingCriteria should call itself if a category is
      selected from the given category.
    Modified scrolls.bsk to use pass "true" as the third parameter to
      rGetAnyMatchingCriteria, to make scroll selection more flexible
      and robust.
    Added "optExcludeGems" and "optExcludeArt" attributes to attributes.bsk.
    Changed rGenerateGoodsByEncounterLevel to use new optExcludeGems
      and optExcludeArt attributes, if set.
    Changed rGenerateTreasureByEncounterLevel to generate goods or coins if
      items have been banned (by setting percentage to 0).
    Added potion descriptions submitted by Spencer Cooley. (descriptions.bsk
      file added, potions.bsk modified, index.bsk modified).
    Added Dragon Magazine data submitted by Robert Szkotak (dkphoenix@hotmail.com).
    Fixed treasure.bsk so that similar items are counted together, rather than
      separately.
    Fixed display.bsk so that if a spell is scribed multiple times on a single
      scroll, a message is displayed indicating how many times it has been
      scribed on that scroll.
  Library Changes:
    Modified bsktokens.h, bsklexer.c, bskparse.c to handle new
      preferred syntax for specifying parent categories for entities
      (using the "in" keyword).
    Modified BSKGetMemberByIndex in bskctgry.c to be clearer.
    Fixed bug in bskexec.c (in the "WeightOf" built-in function) where
      the parameters were being swapped.
    Increased maximum string length in bsklexer.c from 256 to 4095 to
      accomodate larger strings in basilisk files.
    Added BSKStackFrameGetLineNumber function to bskexec module.
    Added "line" member to BSKStackFrame to store current line number on
      a per-stack-frame basis (for use in stack tracing).
    Removed typecasts from bskvalue.c, replacing them with BSKMemCpy calls.
      Same with bskexec.c.  This fixed a core-dump issue on Irix 6.5 and
      HPUX 10.2.
