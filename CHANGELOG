version 1.01
  Makefile changes:
		Added "library" target to Makefile for making a dynamic-loading basilisk
			library. (Required significant modifications to the makefile).
	Utility changes:
		Changed names of 4 callback functions in bskcallback.c:
			myConsole -> BSKDefaultConsole
			myRTEHandler -> BSKDefaultRuntimeErrorHandler
			myErrorHandler -> BSKDefaultParseErrorHandler
			printStackTrace -> BSKPrintStackTrace
		Added a FILE* parameter to BSKPrintStackTrace.
		Added a new type to bskcallback.h (BSKCallbackData) which should be
			passed as the "userData" parameter to BSKExec and BSKParse
			whenever one of the "default" callbacks are used.
		Changes bskcompile.c, bskrun.c, and bsktreasure.c to use the new
			callback functions.
		Modified BSKPrintStackTrace to use new "line" member of BSKStackFrame
			to tell what line of what rule was called, for each level of the
			stack.
	Documentation Changes:
		Modified script.bnf to reflect the new preferred syntax for specifying
			parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
		Modified dff.html to include documentation for new preferred syntax
			for specifying parent categories for entities (using the "in"
			keyword).
		Modified tutorial1.html to use new preferred syntax for specifying
			parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
		Added a new tutorial (tutorial2.html) -- "Adding Data, Part 2"
		Added undocumented functions from bskexec.
	Data Changes:
		Modified all data files to use the new preferred syntax for specifying
			parent categories for entities (using the "in" keyword).
		Alphabetized deity list in deities.bsk.
		Replaced gems.bsk with data from Spencer Cooley (MUCH more detail).
		Modified rings.bsk, wands.bsk, and staves.bsk to compute item cost
			proportionally to the number of charges remaining in the item.
		Modified "rGetAnyMatchingCriteria" rule (in utilities.bsk) to accept
			an optional third parameter ("recursive") that, when true, indicates
			that rGetAnyMatchingCriteria should call itself if a category is
			selected from the given category.
		Modified scrolls.bsk to use pass "true" as the third parameter to
			rGetAnyMatchingCriteria, to make scroll selection more flexible
			and robust.
		Added "optExcludeGems" and "optExcludeArt" attributes to attributes.bsk.
		Changed rGenerateGoodsByEncounterLevel to use new optExcludeGems
			and optExcludeArt attributes, if set.
		Changed rGenerateTreasureByEncounterLevel to generate goods or coins if
			items have been banned (by setting percentage to 0).
	Library Changes:
		Modified bsktokens.h, bsklexer.c, bskparse.c to handle new
			preferred syntax for specifying parent categories for entities
			(using the "in" keyword).
		Modified BSKGetMemberByIndex in bskctgry.c to be clearer.
		Fixed bug in bskexec.c (in the "WeightOf" built-in function) where
			the parameters were being swapped.
		Increased maximum string length in bsklexer.c from 256 to 4095 to
			accomodate larger strings in basilisk files.
		Added BSKStackFrameGetLineNumber function to bskexec module.
		Added "line" member to BSKStackFrame to store current line number on
			a per-stack-frame basis (for use in stack tracing).
